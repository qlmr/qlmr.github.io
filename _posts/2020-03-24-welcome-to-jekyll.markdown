Welcome,

Suffice it to say that my name is Quin. I'm a student from Montreal, Quebec,
with a life long interest in privacy and how privacy or the lack of it affects
the world. I am working to understand the complexities of the digital world by
learning to program, while also learning about economics and sociology at the
same time.

While I'm a busy student, I hope to find the time to document and share the
things I learn.
