# Big Data and Location tracking

With Google's recent announcement about their [COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports](https://google.com/covid19/mobility)
I was beginning to think now would be a good time to share my thoughts on big Data handle
how they handle privacy.

## Policy

Outwardly Google maintains that they keep "stringent privacy protocols and policies". Despite
that claim, I'm reminded that [Google was recently fined for bypassing Safari privacy settings.](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/google-receives-record-fine-for-bypassing-safari/)
The conflict between policy and practice at Google does not leave the User with a great
deal of confidence in their stringent protocols.

## A software solution?

Somewhere out there in the world is a software solution to this question of conflict and
trust, that also addresses the technical vulnerabilities created for either convenience
or to satisfy the "rule of cool". Open Source Software is definitely a step in the
right direction. Transparency in code is part of the recipe that creates trust. I'm
starting to see that the next ingredient has to be [security by design.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design)

I'm a long way from understanding how security by design is implemented in the real world,
but it seems to me that many systems would require complete redesigns. In a world that doesn't
see the idea of "sunk costs" as the fallacy that it is, how do we start this kind of
revolution?
